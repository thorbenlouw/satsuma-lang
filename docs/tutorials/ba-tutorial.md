# Satsuma for Business Analysts — A Practical Tutorial

## What Is Satsuma and Why Should You Care?

If you've ever worked on a data migration, system integration, or ETL project, you already know the pain of **source-to-target mapping documents**. They're almost always Excel spreadsheets — columns for Source Field, Target Field, Transformation, Data Type, Comments — and they're almost always a mess.

Every team invents its own layout. Transformation logic lives in free-text cells like *"Convert to uppercase and validate"* (but what does "validate" mean, exactly?). Files get emailed, copied to SharePoint, and edited by three people at once. Which version is current? Nobody's entirely sure. And when an issue crops up in production six months later, nobody can trace the ambiguous spreadsheet cell back to a conscious decision.

**Satsuma** is a simple, readable language designed to replace those spreadsheets. It's a plain-text format that you can version in Git, review in pull requests, and — crucially — read without needing a decoder ring.

Think of Satsuma as sitting between the business requirements and the implementation code. It captures **what** the data transformation should do — precisely enough that an engineer (or an AI agent) can implement it, yet readably enough that a BA can review and sign it off.

Here's the headline: **if you can read a column list in a database tool, you can read Satsuma**. This tutorial will walk you through the syntax step by step, starting from the simplest possible mapping and building up to real-world complexity.

---

## Your First Mapping: Two Fields, One Line

Let's start with the smallest useful Satsuma file. Imagine you're migrating customer records from an old system to a new one, and right now you only care about mapping the customer identifier.

```satsuma
schema old_system {
  CUST_ID   INT
}

schema new_system {
  customer_id   UUID
}

mapping {
  source { `old_system` }
  target { `new_system` }

  CUST_ID -> customer_id
}
```

Three types of block, and you can already see the entire story:

1. **`schema`** — describes the structure of a data source or target. Every system, whether a database table, JSON API, XML message, or flat file, uses this same keyword.
2. **`mapping`** — ties schemas together. Its `source { }` and `target { }` sub-blocks identify which schemas are being mapped by name. Arrow declarations follow.
3. **`->`** — the heart of Satsuma. Read it as *"maps to"* or *"becomes"*.

The schema names (`` `old_system` ``, `` `new_system` ``) inside the mapping block point to the schemas defined above. Backtick quoting is needed only when a name contains characters outside `[a-z0-9_]`; simple snake_case names can be written without backticks.

That's it. You've just read your first Satsuma file.

---

## Adding Data Types and Metadata

Fields in a schema block follow a consistent pattern:

```satsuma
field_name    DATA_TYPE    (metadata)
```

Metadata appears in **parentheses** `( )` and captures the details you'd normally scatter across several Excel columns — whether a field is a primary key, whether it's required, what values are allowed, and so on:

```satsuma
schema old_system {
  CUST_ID       INT            (pk)
  CUST_TYPE     CHAR(1)        (enum {R, B, G})
  EMAIL_ADDR    VARCHAR(255)   (pii)
  CREDIT_LIMIT  DECIMAL(12,2)  (default 0)
}

schema new_system {
  customer_id     UUID           (pk, required)
  customer_type   VARCHAR(20)    (enum {retail, business, government}, required)
  email           VARCHAR(255)   (format email, pii)
  credit_limit    BIGINT         (default 0)
}
```

Some of the metadata tokens you'll encounter most often:

| Token | What It Means |
| ----- | ------------- |
| `pk` | Primary key |
| `required` | Must not be null or empty |
| `pii` | Personally identifiable information — flag for governance |
| `encrypt` | Must be encrypted (optionally specifying algorithm, e.g. `encrypt AES-256-GCM`) |
| `enum {a, b, c}` | Only these values are allowed |
| `default val` | Default value if the source is null |
| `format email` | Expected format (email, E.164, UUID, etc.) |
| `ref table.field` | Foreign key reference to another schema |

Notice that **data types are freeform** — Satsuma doesn't enforce a type system. You write whatever matches the real system: `VARCHAR(200)`, `STRING(200)`, `DECIMAL(12,2)`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`. The goal is to describe what actually exists, not to conform to an abstract type model.

---

## Transforms: Where the Logic Lives

A bare arrow (`->`) is fine for direct copies, but most real mappings require some transformation. In Satsuma, you add transforms in `{ }` after the arrow:

```satsuma
mapping {
  source { `old_system` }
  target { `new_system` }

  CUST_ID -> customer_id

  EMAIL_ADDR -> email { trim | lowercase | validate_email }

  CREDIT_LIMIT -> credit_limit { coalesce(0) | * 100 | round }
}
```

The pipe character (`|`) chains transforms left to right, exactly like a Unix pipeline. Reading the email mapping aloud: *"Take `EMAIL_ADDR`, trim leading and trailing whitespace, convert to lowercase, then validate it as an email address."*

The credit limit mapping: *"Take `CREDIT_LIMIT`, replace null with zero, multiply by 100 (converting to cents), then round."*

This is one of Satsuma's big wins over spreadsheets. Instead of a free-text cell saying *"Clean up and convert to cents"*, you get a precise, ordered sequence of operations that an engineer can implement directly.

### Value Maps

When a source field uses codes that need translating to human-readable values, use a `map { }` block:

```satsuma
CUST_TYPE -> customer_type {
  map {
    R: "retail"
    B: "business"
    G: "government"
    null: "retail"
  }
}
```

This replaces the classic Excel approach of listing value mappings in a separate tab or a comments column. Everything stays together. The special key `null` handles missing values; `default` or `_` acts as a wildcard fallback for anything not explicitly listed.

### Range-Based Maps

For tier assignments and other range conditions, the `map { }` block supports comparison operators:

```satsuma
LOYALTY_POINTS -> loyalty_tier {
  map {
    < 1000:  "bronze"
    < 5000:  "silver"
    < 10000: "gold"
    default: "platinum"
  }
}
```

Read it just as you'd read a business rule: *"If loyalty points are below 1,000, assign 'bronze'; below 5,000, 'silver'; below 10,000, 'gold'; otherwise 'platinum'."*

### Computed Fields

Not every target field has a direct source. Some are calculated from multiple inputs, some are constants. Omit the left side of the arrow to signal a **computed field**:

```satsuma
-> display_name {
  "If CUST_TYPE is null or 'R', trim and concat FIRST_NM + ' ' + LAST_NM.
   Otherwise, trim COMPANY_NM."
}

-> migration_timestamp { now_utc() }
```

The quoted string is a natural-language transform — more on those in a moment. `now_utc()` is a function call with no source input.

### Fallback Sources

When a preferred source field might be null, describe the fallback within the transform pipeline:

```satsuma
LAST_MOD_DATE -> updated_at {
  parse("MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss a") | to_utc
  | "If null, fall back to CREATED_DATE parsed as MM/DD/YYYY in UTC"
}
```

*"Try to parse `LAST_MOD_DATE`. If it's null, fall back to `CREATED_DATE` instead."* This replaces the "if blank, use column X" note you'd normally bury in a comment.

---

## Comments That Actually Mean Something

Satsuma has three kinds of comment, each carrying a different signal:

```satsuma
// A normal informational comment
//! A warning — a known risk, issue, or data-quality problem
//? A question or TODO — something that still needs resolving
```

The `//!` and `//?` variants aren't just cosmetic. Tooling can scan for them automatically and surface a count of unresolved questions or known risks — perfect for a BA tracking open items before sign-off.

```satsuma
EMAIL_ADDR    VARCHAR(255)   (pii)           //! Not validated — contains garbage
CREATED_DATE  VARCHAR(10)                    //! Stored as MM/DD/YYYY string
STATE_PROV    VARCHAR(50)                    //? Should we normalise to 2-char codes?
```

---

## Notes: Rich Documentation In-Line

For longer explanations — context a developer or reviewer needs, data-quality background, open issues — Satsuma provides two ways to attach notes.

**On schemas and fields**, notes are metadata, so they go in `( )`. Use `"..."` for a short note, or `"""..."""` when you need Markdown headings, bullet points, or multiple paragraphs:

```satsuma
schema legacy_customers (note "Primary customer store from 2005–2024.") {
  PHONE_NBR  VARCHAR(50) (
    note """
    No consistent format across the dataset:
    - **42%** `(555) 123-4567` — US with parentheses
    - **31%** `555.123.4567` — dot-separated
    - **15%** `+15551234567` — already E.164
    - **8%** `5551234567` — raw 10-digit
    - **4%** other (international, extensions, garbage)
    """
  )
}
```

**At file level or inside mapping blocks**, use a standalone `note { }` block:

```satsuma
note {
  """
  # Legacy Customer Migration

  Part of **Project Phoenix** — decommissioning the legacy SQL Server 2008
  instance by Q2 2026. Migrates customer records to a normalized PostgreSQL
  schema with proper typing, encryption, and referential integrity.

  ## Constraints
  - Runs in **batches of 10,000** to prevent memory issues
  - Target enforces referential integrity — addresses created *before* customers
  - Estimated total: **2.4M records**, ~180 batches
  """
}
```

A `note { }` at the top of the file documents the whole integration. One inside a `mapping { }` block documents that specific mapping's assumptions. Because notes travel with the specification, they don't drift out of date the way a Confluence page does.

---

## Natural Language Transforms: Bridging the Gap

Sometimes a transformation is too complex or context-dependent to express as a neat chain of functions. In Satsuma, a quoted string directly inside `{ }` is a **natural-language transform**:

```satsuma
PHONE_NBR -> phone {
  "Extract all digits. If 11 digits starting with 1, treat as US.
   If 10 digits, assume US country code +1. Format as E.164.
   For other patterns, attempt to determine country from COUNTRY_CD.
   If unparseable, set null and log warning with original value."
}
```

This says to both the engineer and any AI tooling: *"This needs custom implementation — here's the intent."* It's an honest acknowledgement that not every business rule can be reduced to a neat function call — but it still belongs *in the spec*, not in someone's head or lost in a meeting note.

Natural language mixes seamlessly with parseable pipeline steps:

```satsuma
NOTES -> notes {
  "Filter profanity using corporate word list v3.2, replacing matches with asterisks"
  | escape_html
  | truncate(5000)
}
```

This is enormously valuable for BAs. You can describe complex business logic in plain English *within the mapping spec itself*, sitting right next to the parseable transforms. No more hunting through email threads or Jira comments for the "real" requirements.

---

## Nested Structures: `record` and `list`

Real data is rarely flat. Satsuma handles nested structures with two keywords that follow the field name:

- **`record`** — a single nested object (one instance per parent record)
- **`list_of record`** — a repeated nested object (zero or more instances per parent record)

```satsuma
schema order {
  order_id   STRING (pk)
  customer record {
    id     STRING
    email  STRING (pii)
  }
  line_items list_of record {
    sku         STRING (required)
    quantity    INT
    unit_price  DECIMAL(12,2)
  }
}
```

Both keywords can be nested to any depth. Use `each` blocks in mappings to iterate over repeated structures, and a `.` prefix means "relative to the current nesting context":

```satsuma
each LineItems -> .items {
  .ITEMNO -> .item { trim }
  .QUANTITY -> .unitQuantity { "Divide by 10000 for 4 implied decimal places" }
}
```

### Flatten: Exploding Arrays into Rows

A common ETL pattern is taking a single source record with an array and producing one output row per array element. Satsuma makes this explicit with a `flatten` block inside the mapping:

```satsuma
mapping `order lines` {
  source { `commerce_order` }
  target { `order_lines_parquet` }

  flatten Order.LineItems -> order_lines {
    Order.OrderId -> order_id
    .SKU -> sku { trim | uppercase }
    .Quantity -> quantity
  }
}
```

The `flatten` block tells the reader: *"For each element in `LineItems`, emit one target row. Parent-level fields like `OrderId` are repeated."*

This is one of those patterns that's notoriously difficult to express in a spreadsheet. You'd typically need a separate tab or a paragraph of explanation. In Satsuma, it's a dedicated block and the nested arrow paths make the grain of the target table completely unambiguous.

---

## Multiple Sources and Joins

Enterprise integrations rarely involve just one source. When a mapping draws from multiple schemas, list them all in the `source { }` block and describe the join in natural language:

```satsuma
mapping `opportunity enrichment` {
  source {
    `sfdc_opportunity`
    `sfdc_account`
    "Join on sfdc_opportunity.AccountId = sfdc_account.Id"
  }
  target { `snowflake_opps` }
  // arrow declarations follow...
}
```

---

## Imports and Reuse

In a large programme, the same structures appear again and again — address blocks, audit columns, phone normalisation logic. Satsuma lets you define these once and share them.

### Fragments

A **fragment** is a reusable set of fields:

```satsuma
// lib/common.stm
fragment `address fields` {
  street_line_1   VARCHAR(200)
  street_line_2   VARCHAR(200)
  city            VARCHAR(100)
  state_province  VARCHAR(50)
  postal_code     VARCHAR(20)
  country_code    CHAR(2)
}
```

Pull it into a schema using the spread operator (`...`):

```satsuma
import { `address fields` } from "lib/common.stm"

schema customers {
  customer_id    UUID          (pk)
  display_name   VARCHAR(200)  (required)
  ...`address fields`
}
```

The fields from `` `address fields` `` are inlined as if you'd typed them directly. When the address structure changes, you update it in one place.

### Named Transforms

A **named transform** is a reusable pipeline or natural-language step:

```satsuma
transform `clean email` {
  "Trim whitespace, lowercase, validate RFC 5322 format, return null if invalid"
}

transform `to utc date` {
  parse("MM/DD/YYYY") | assume_utc | to_iso8601
}
```

Spread them into mapping pipelines with `...`:

```satsuma
EMAIL_ADDR   -> email      { ...`clean email` }
CREATED_DATE -> created_at { ...`to utc date` }
```

### Imports

The `import` statement brings fragments, transforms, or schemas from other files into scope:

```satsuma
import { `address fields`, `audit fields` } from "lib/common.stm"
import { `currency rates` } from "lookups/finance.stm"
```

This supports splitting large specifications across multiple files — one per source system, perhaps, or one per domain — while keeping each individual file focused and readable.

---

## Format-Specific Metadata

When working with XML, EDI, CSV, or other structured formats, extraction hints go in `( )` — the same parentheses used for all other metadata. There's no separate annotation syntax to learn.

```satsuma
schema commerce_order (
  format xml,
  namespace ord "http://example.com/commerce/order/v2",
  namespace com "http://example.com/common/v1"
) {
  Order record (xpath "/ord:OrderMessage/ord:Order") {
    OrderId   STRING  (xpath "ord:OrderId")
    Channel   STRING  (xpath "ord:Channel")
  }
}
```

For fixed-length EDI, use `filter` in `( )` to restrict a list to matching elements:

```satsuma
POReferences list_of record (filter REFQUAL == "ON") {
  REFQUAL   CHAR(3)
  REFNUM    CHAR(35)   // PO Number + "/" + Dissection No
}
```

You don't need to understand every format detail — the important thing is that extraction logic stays *inside the mapping spec* rather than buried in implementation code.

---

## Putting It All Together

Here's a realistic Salesforce-to-Snowflake integration, the kind of mapping you might review as a BA on a revenue operations project:

```satsuma
// Satsuma — Salesforce to Snowflake Pipeline

import { `sfdc standard types` } from "lib/sfdc_fragments.stm"
import { `currency rates` } from "lookups/finance.stm"

note {
  """
  # Salesforce to Snowflake Pipeline

  Maps Sales Cloud `Opportunity` and `Account` objects into the
  `ANALYTICS.RAW_SFDC` schema.

  ## Sync Strategy
  - **Incremental:** Uses `SystemModStamp` to pull changes every 15 minutes.
  - **Hard Deletes:** Captured via the `isDeleted` flag in SFDC.
  """
}


// --- Sources ---

schema sfdc_opportunity (note "SFDC Opportunity Object") {
  Id                      ID              (pk)
  Name                    STRING(120)     (required)
  AccountId               ID              (ref sfdc_account.Id)
  Amount                  CURRENCY(18,2)
  CurrencyIsoCode         STRING(3)       (default "USD")
  StageName               PICKLIST        (enum {Prospecting, Qualification, "Value Prop", Closed_Won, Closed_Lost})
  CloseDate               DATE            (required)

}

  Name            STRING(255)    (required)
  BillingCountry  STRING(80)
}


// --- Target ---

schema snowflake_opps (note "FACT_OPPORTUNITIES — Snowflake Analytics") {
  opp_key          VARCHAR(18)   (pk)
  account_key      VARCHAR(18)   (indexed)
  opportunity_name VARCHAR(120)
  amount_raw       NUMBER(18,2)
  amount_usd       NUMBER(18,2)  (note "Converted at daily spot rate")
  arr_value        NUMBER(18,2)  (required)
  pipeline_stage   VARCHAR(50)   (enum {top_funnel, mid_funnel, closed_won, closed_lost})
  is_closed        BOOLEAN
  close_date       DATE
  source_system    VARCHAR(10)   (default "SFDC")
  ingested_at      TIMESTAMP_NTZ
}


// --- Mapping ---

mapping `opportunity ingestion` {
  source { `sfdc_opportunity` }
  target { `snowflake_opps` }

  // --- Direct identifiers ---
  Id        -> opp_key
  AccountId -> account_key
  Name      -> opportunity_name

  // --- Financial ---
  Amount -> amount_raw { coalesce(0) }

  Amount -> amount_usd {
    "Multiply by rate from `currency rates` lookup using CurrencyIsoCode"
    | round(2)
  }

  `ARR_Override__c` -> arr_value {
    "Use ARR_Override__c if not null, otherwise fall back to Amount"
    | coalesce(0)
  }

  // --- Stage normalization ---
  StageName -> pipeline_stage {
    map {
      Prospecting:  "top_funnel"
      Qualification: "mid_funnel"
      "Value Prop":  "mid_funnel"
      Closed_Won:    "closed_won"
      Closed_Lost:   "closed_lost"
      _:             "unknown"
    }
  }

  -> is_closed {
    "True if StageName is 'Closed_Won' or 'Closed_Lost', false otherwise."
  }

  CloseDate      -> close_date
  SystemModStamp -> ingested_at { to_utc }
}
```

Even if you've never seen Satsuma before today, you can follow this specification and answer questions like:

- *"What happens if Amount is null?"* — The `arr_value` mapping shows `coalesce(0)`, so it becomes zero.
- *"How is pipeline stage determined?"* — There's an explicit value map from Salesforce picklist values to Snowflake categories.
- *"What about currency conversion?"* — The `amount_usd` mapping uses a natural-language description explaining it uses the `currency rates` lookup.
- *"What if Finance has overridden the ARR?"* — `ARR_Override__c` takes priority, with `Amount` as a fallback.

Compare that to hunting through a spreadsheet's comments column, a Confluence page, and a Slack thread to piece together the same answers.

### Satsuma vs the Spreadsheet: A Side-by-Side

To make the contrast concrete, consider how the stage-mapping rule above would look in a typical Excel mapping document:

| Source Field | Target Field | Transformation | Notes |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------- | ----- |
| StageName | pipeline_stage | Map values (see lookup tab) | Prospecting=top_funnel, Qualification=mid_funnel, etc. |

That single row raises immediate questions. *"What about 'Value Prop' — is that top or mid funnel?"* *"What if the value doesn't match any of these?"* *"Where's the lookup tab — is it in this workbook or another one?"* The Satsuma `map { }` block answers all of these inline, with a `_` wildcard for unrecognised values. There's no lookup tab to lose, no ambiguity to resolve in a follow-up meeting.

---

## Metrics: Defining What You Measure

Data pipelines don't just move data — they feed business metrics. Satsuma has a dedicated `metric` keyword for declaring KPIs and measures, so that the definition of *"what does MRR mean?"* lives alongside the schemas and mappings it depends on, not in a Confluence page that nobody updates.

A metric block says: **what** the metric measures, **where** the data comes from, and **how** it can be sliced. It doesn't describe the implementation step-by-step — that's what mappings are for. Instead, the `note { }` block captures the business definition in natural language.

```satsuma
metric monthly_recurring_revenue "MRR" (
  source fact_subscriptions,
  grain monthly,
  slice {customer_segment, product_line, region},
  filter "status = 'active' AND is_trial = false"
) {
  value  DECIMAL(14,2)  (measure additive)

  note {
    "Sum of active subscription amounts, normalized to monthly.
     Annual subscriptions divided by 12. Quarterly by 3.
     Excludes trials and churned subscriptions."
  }
}
```

Reading this aloud: *"MRR is a monthly metric sourced from `fact_subscriptions`, filtered to active non-trial rows, sliceable by segment, product line, and region. Its value is additive — you can sum it across any dimension."*

The metadata tokens in `( )` work exactly like the ones you've already seen on schemas and fields:

| Token | What It Means |
| ----- | ------------- |
| `source` | Which schema(s) feed this metric |
| `grain` | The time grain (daily, monthly, etc.) |
| `slice` | Dimensions you can cut the metric by |
| `filter` | Row-level condition applied before aggregation |
| `measure additive` | Can be summed across all dimensions |
| `measure non_additive` | Cannot be summed (ratios, averages) |
| `measure semi_additive` | Can be summed across some dimensions but not time (e.g. account balances) |

A metric with multiple measures and multi-source lineage:

```satsuma
metric customer_lifetime_value "CLV" (
  source {fact_orders, dim_customer},
  slice {acquisition_channel, segment, cohort_year}
) {
  value              DECIMAL(14,2)  (measure non_additive)
  order_count        INTEGER        (measure additive)
  avg_order_value    DECIMAL(12,2)  (measure non_additive)

  note {
    """
    Average revenue per customer over their entire tenure.
    Calculated as: total_revenue / months_active * expected_lifetime_months.
    Expected lifetime derived from cohort survival curves.
    """
  }
}
```

Metrics are *not* schemas — you can't use them as a source or target in a mapping. They sit at the end of the lineage graph: data flows *into* a metric, nothing flows *out*. Think of them as the answer to the question *"why are we building this pipeline?"*

---

## Reports and ML Models: Describing Downstream Consumers

Metrics aren't the only things that consume your data pipeline. Dashboards, scheduled reports, and ML models also depend on specific schemas — and when someone changes a field upstream, you need to know what breaks downstream.

Satsuma handles these using the same building blocks you already know: a `schema` with metadata tokens that declare intent. The `report` or `model` token tells tooling (and humans) that this isn't a database table to be loaded — it's a downstream consumer.

### Reports

```satsuma
schema weekly_sales_dashboard (
  report,
  source {fact_orders, dim_customer, dim_product, dim_date},
  owner "bi-team",
  refresh "Monday 06:00 UTC",
  tool looker dashboard_id "sales-weekly-exec"
) {
  note {
    """
    # Weekly Sales Dashboard

    Executive-facing dashboard showing:
    - Revenue by region (bar chart, MTD vs prior month)
    - Top 10 products by units sold
    - New customer acquisition funnel
    - Pipeline coverage ratio (3x target)

    **Filters:** Region, Product Line, Sales Rep
    **Audience:** VP Sales and above
    """
  }
}
```

A BA reads this and immediately knows: *"This Looker dashboard depends on four schemas, refreshes Monday mornings, and is owned by the BI team."* An engineer reads the `source` list and knows which tables must be stable before the refresh runs. If you're ever asked *"what will break if we rename a column in `dim_product`?"*, the `source` references give you the answer.

### ML Models

```satsuma
schema churn_predictor (
  model,
  source {dim_customer, fact_orders, fact_support_tickets},
  owner "ml-engineering",
  refresh "daily",
  registry mlflow experiment "churn-v3"
) {
  features record {
    note {
      """
      - days_since_last_order (from fact_orders)
      - support_ticket_count_30d (from fact_support_tickets)
      - lifetime_order_value (from fact_orders)
      - customer_tenure_months (from dim_customer)
      - product_category_diversity (from fact_orders + dim_product)
      """
    }
  }

  output record {
    churn_probability  DECIMAL(5,4)
    churn_risk_tier    VARCHAR(10)  (enum {low, medium, high})
  }

  note {
    "XGBoost classifier. Retrained daily on 24-month rolling window.
     Threshold: >= 0.7 = high risk, triggers retention campaign."
  }
}
```

The key insight is that no new syntax is needed. The `report` and `model` tokens are vocabulary tokens in `( )` metadata — the same mechanism used for `pk`, `pii`, and everything else. Tooling interprets them to build lineage graphs and dependency maps, while the `note { }` blocks carry the human-readable context.

## Data Modelling: Kimball Stars and Data Vault

If you work on a data warehouse or lakehouse project, you're likely using either **Kimball** (star schemas with dimensions and facts) or **Data Vault** (hubs, links, and satellites). Satsuma handles both using vocabulary tokens in `( )` metadata — no special syntax needed, just conventions that declare the *intent* behind a schema.

This matters for BAs because dimensional and vault patterns have a lot of mechanical boilerplate (surrogate keys, SCD history columns, hash keys, load timestamps). In Satsuma, you declare the intent — *"this is a Type 2 slowly changing dimension"* — and the interpreter or tooling infers the boilerplate. You see the business fields; the engineer sees the pattern.

### Kimball: Dimensions and Facts

A **dimension** is a schema that describes a business entity you want to analyse by — customers, products, stores, dates. A **fact** is a schema that records measurable events — sales transactions, inventory snapshots, clicks.

Here's a customer dimension with SCD Type 2 history tracking:

```satsuma
schema dim_customer (
  dimension, conformed, scd 2,
  natural_key customer_id,
  track {email, phone, loyalty_tier, preferred_store_id, first_name, last_name},
  ignore {last_login_channel, lifetime_order_count, lifetime_spend}
) {
  customer_id          VARCHAR(50)     (required)
  first_name           VARCHAR(100)
  last_name            VARCHAR(100)
  full_name            VARCHAR(200)
  email                VARCHAR(255)    (pii)
  phone                VARCHAR(20)     (pii)
  loyalty_tier         VARCHAR(20)     (enum {bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond})
  loyalty_points       INTEGER
  preferred_store_id   VARCHAR(20)
  member_since         DATE
  lifetime_order_count INTEGER         (default 0)
  lifetime_spend       DECIMAL(14,2)   (default 0)
  customer_segment     VARCHAR(30)
}
```

Reading the metadata tokens:

- **`dimension`** — this schema represents a dimension table
- **`conformed`** — it's shared across multiple star schemas (not specific to one fact table)
- **`scd 2`** — Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2: when tracked fields change, the old row is closed and a new version is created, preserving history
- **`natural_key customer_id`** — the business key that identifies a customer across versions
- **`track {email, phone, ...}`** — changes to *these* fields trigger a new version
- **`ignore {last_login_channel, ...}`** — changes to *these* fields do NOT trigger a new version (too volatile)

The SCD Type 2 mechanical columns — `surrogate_key`, `valid_from`, `valid_to`, `is_current`, `row_hash` — are **inferred** by the interpreter. You don't need to list them. A BA sees the business fields; the engineer knows the physical pattern from the `scd 2` token.

Here's a fact table referencing dimensions:

```satsuma
schema fact_sales (
  fact,
  grain {transaction_id, line_number},
  ref dim_customer on customer_id,
  ref dim_product on sku,
  ref dim_store on store_id,
  ref dim_date on transaction_date
) {
  transaction_id       VARCHAR(30)     (required)
  line_number          INTEGER         (required)
  transaction_date     DATE            (required)
  customer_id          VARCHAR(50)
  sku                  VARCHAR(18)     (required)
  store_id             VARCHAR(20)
  channel              VARCHAR(20)     (required, degenerate)

  // Measures
  quantity             INTEGER         (required, measure additive)
  unit_price           DECIMAL(10,2)   (required, measure non_additive)
  gross_amount         DECIMAL(12,2)   (required, measure additive)
  discount_amount      DECIMAL(10,2)   (default 0, measure additive)
  tax_amount           DECIMAL(10,2)   (default 0, measure additive)
  net_amount           DECIMAL(12,2)   (required, measure additive)
}
```

The tokens tell the whole story:

- **`fact`** — this is a fact table
- **`grain {transaction_id, line_number}`** — one row per line item per transaction
- **`ref dim_customer on customer_id`** — foreign key relationship to the customer dimension
- **`degenerate`** — `channel` is a dimension attribute stored directly in the fact (no separate dimension table)
- **`measure additive`** / **`measure non_additive`** — tells BI tools and engineers which fields can be summed and which can't

### Data Vault: Hubs, Satellites, and Links

Data Vault is an alternative warehouse architecture designed for agility and auditability. Where Kimball models are business-oriented (dimensions and facts), Data Vault separates concerns into three building blocks:

- **Hub** — a registry of unique business keys (e.g. all customer IDs across all source systems)
- **Satellite** — descriptive attributes attached to a hub, versioned over time (SCD Type 2)
- **Link** — a relationship between two or more hubs (e.g. "customer X bought product Y at store Z")

```satsuma
schema hub_customer (
  hub,
  business_key customer_id
) {
  customer_id          VARCHAR(50)     (required)
}
```

That's the entire hub. The mechanical columns — `hub_customer_hk` (hash key), `load_date`, `record_source` — are inferred from the `hub` token. You declare only the business key.

Satellites carry the descriptive data:

```satsuma
schema sat_customer_demographics (
  satellite,
  parent hub_customer,
  scd 2
) {
  first_name           VARCHAR(100)
  last_name            VARCHAR(100)
  email                VARCHAR(255)    (pii)
  phone                VARCHAR(20)     (pii)
  loyalty_tier         VARCHAR(20)
  loyalty_points       INTEGER
  preferred_store_id   VARCHAR(20)
  opt_in_email         BOOLEAN
  opt_in_sms           BOOLEAN
}
```

The `satellite` and `parent hub_customer` tokens tell you: *"These fields describe a customer and are versioned against the customer hub."* The hash key, load timestamps, and hash diff column are inferred.

Links capture relationships. A sale involves a customer, a product, and a store — that's a three-way link:

```satsuma
schema link_sale (
  link {hub_customer, hub_product, hub_store}
) {
  // The link itself is just the relationship.
  // Hash keys for each hub and the link's own hash key are inferred.
}
```

Mappings into vault targets look like regular Satsuma mappings — the `hub`, `satellite`, and `link` tokens only affect the target schema's physical structure, not the mapping syntax:

```satsuma
mapping `sfdc to hub_customer` {
  source { `loyalty_sfdc` }
  target { `hub_customer` }

  ContactId -> customer_id
  -> record_source { "SFDC" }
}

mapping `sfdc to sat_customer_demographics` {
  source { `loyalty_sfdc` }
  target { `sat_customer_demographics` }

  FirstName -> first_name              { trim | title_case }
  LastName -> last_name                { trim | title_case }
  Email -> email                       { trim | lowercase | validate_email | null_if_invalid }
  Phone -> phone                       { trim | to_e164 }
  LoyaltyTier -> loyalty_tier          { lowercase }
  LoyaltyPoints -> loyalty_points
  -> record_source { "SFDC" }
}
```

### Which Approach Should You Use?

You don't need to choose between these approaches to use Satsuma — both use the same syntax. The tokens are just vocabulary conventions:

| Token | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `dimension` | Kimball dimension table |
| `fact` | Kimball fact table |
| `conformed` | Dimension shared across star schemas |
| `grain {fields}` | What one row represents |
| `scd 2` | Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (preserve history) |
| `natural_key` | Business key for SCD tracking |
| `track {fields}` | Fields that trigger new SCD versions |
| `ignore {fields}` | Fields that don't trigger new versions |
| `hub` | Data Vault hub (business key registry) |
| `satellite` | Data Vault satellite (descriptive attributes) |
| `link {hubs}` | Data Vault link (relationship) |
| `business_key` | Hub's business key |
| `parent` | Which hub a satellite belongs to |
| `measure additive` | Summable across all dimensions |
| `measure non_additive` | Not summable |
| `degenerate` | Dimension attribute stored in the fact |

The key takeaway: Satsuma's `( )` metadata system is extensible. Whether you're building a Kimball star, a Data Vault, or something else entirely, you declare intent with tokens and let tooling handle the mechanical details.

## Next Steps

You don't need to memorise every detail in this tutorial. The key takeaways are:

1. **Satsuma is readable** — if you can read a database column list, you can read Satsuma.
2. **Everything lives in one place** — schema definitions, mapping logic, transformation rules, data-quality warnings, and documentation all sit together in a single versionable file.
3. **Precision replaces ambiguity** — instead of free-text descriptions, transforms are explicit pipelines. Where precision isn't practical, quoted natural-language blocks capture intent rather than leaving it to tribal knowledge.
4. **It scales** — from a two-field proof of concept to a multi-source enterprise data hub, Satsuma uses the same consistent syntax.
5. **It versions naturally** — because Satsuma files are plain text, they slot straight into Git. You get full change history, pull-request reviews, and the ability to diff two versions of a mapping side by side. No more "v7_FINAL_FINAL_reviewed_JK.xlsx".
6. **It describes the full picture** — metrics, reports, ML models, and data warehouse patterns (Kimball stars, Data Vault) all use the same token-based metadata system. One format covers everything from source schemas to the KPIs they feed.

### A practical review checklist

When you next review a mapping specification, try this approach:

1. **Start with the top-level `note { }` block.** Read it for project context, constraints, and dependencies.
2. **Scan the `//!` warnings.** These are known data-quality risks and issues. Make sure each one has a plan — is it handled in the transform, or is it an open item?
3. **Count the `//?` questions.** These are unresolved items. They should all be resolved before sign-off. If any remain, they're your action items.
4. **Walk the mapping block line by line.** For each mapping, ask: *"Does this transform match the business rule we agreed?"* Pay particular attention to value maps and natural-language strings — these encode your business logic.
5. **Check for computed fields (`-> target_field`).**  These target fields have no direct source, so they're easy to miss. Make sure the derivation logic is correct and complete.
6. **Look at fallback descriptions.** These define what happens when preferred data is missing. Confirm the fallback behaviour matches your requirements.

If everything checks out, you can sign it off with confidence. If something doesn't match, you can point to the exact line and say precisely what needs changing — no more ambiguous feedback on a 200-row spreadsheet.

That's a far cry from arguing over which version of the Excel file has the latest transformation logic.
