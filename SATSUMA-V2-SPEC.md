# Satsuma v2 — Language Specification

**Version:** 2.0.0-draft
**Date:** 2026-03-18

---

## 1. Design Philosophy

Satsuma is a concise notation for describing data schemas, mappings, and transformations. It is designed to be read and written by both humans and LLMs.

### Principles

1. **The parser is an LLM.** Structure exists to delineate intent and scope — not to be exhaustively parseable by a formal grammar. Ambiguity that a competent human can resolve is acceptable.
2. **Natural language is a first-class citizen.** Complex transform logic belongs in quoted English, not in a pseudo-programming language.
3. **Three delimiters, three jobs.** `( )` for metadata, `{ }` for structural content, `" "` for natural language. Every use of a delimiter should fit exactly one of these roles.
4. **Token-efficient.** Eliminate ceremony. If something can be inferred, don't require it.
5. **Extensible without grammar changes.** New vocabulary tokens (like `scd`, `datavault`, `hub`) are interpreted by the LLM, not reserved by the language.

---

## 2. Lexical Rules

### 2.1 Delimiters

| Delimiter | Role | Contains |
|-----------|------|----------|
| `( )` | Metadata / annotations | Key-value pairs, flags, notes about the preceding element |
| `{ }` | Structural content | Fields, arrows, map entries, pipe chains, child blocks |
| `" "` | Natural language | Human-readable descriptions, transform logic, documentation |

These roles are **mutually exclusive**. Metadata never appears in `{ }`. Structural children never appear in `( )`. Natural language always uses `" "`.

Metadata blocks `( )` may span multiple lines for readability — especially when they contain long notes or many tokens.

### 2.2 Strings and Quoting

- **Double quotes** `" "` — natural language strings. Always double quotes. Escape inner double quotes with `\"`.
- **Triple double quotes** `""" """` — multiline natural language with Markdown support. No escaping needed for inner `"`. Use for notes with headings, bold, lists, or multi-paragraph content. Leading indentation from the content is preserved as-is.
- **Backticks** `` ` ` `` — identifiers and names that aren't bare-safe. Used for block labels containing special characters (spaces, dots, hyphens) and for field identifiers with special characters.
- **`@` prefix** — structural cross-references in NL text. `@customers.email` references a schema field. Required inside NL strings for tooling to detect refs; optional but allowed everywhere else.

**Two quoting rules:**
- Backticks for names: bare names work when matching `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*`. Everything else gets backticks.
- Double quotes for prose: NL content uses `"..."` or `"""..."""`.

```
schema `My Schema` { ... }           // backtick for name with spaces
`Lead_Source_Detail__c` STRING       // backtick for special-char field identifier
"Look up @customer_id in the dim"    // @ref inside NL string
"Short note — single line"           // single-line string
"""                                  // multiline string with Markdown
# Heading
Some **bold** text and a list:
- Item one
- Item two
"""
```

### 2.3 Block Labels

Block labels (the name after a keyword) use **backticks** when they contain special characters, or are bare identifiers otherwise:

```
schema customers { ... }
schema `order-headers-parquet` { ... }
fragment `US Address` { ... }
```

### 2.4 Comments

| Syntax | Meaning | Behaviour |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| `//` | Comment | Author-side. Stripped by tooling. Not exported. |
| `//!` | Warning | Flags a known issue or risk. May be surfaced by tooling. |
| `//?` | Question/TODO | Open question. May be surfaced by tooling. |

Comments run to end of line. There are no block comments.

### 2.5 Operators

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `->` | Maps source to target |
| `->` (no left side) | Computed/derived target field |
| `\|` | Pipeline step separator |
| `...` | Spread/expand a fragment or named transform |
| `:` | Separator in map entries |

### 2.6 Reserved Keywords

These keywords introduce structural blocks and cannot be used as bare identifiers:

`schema` `fragment` `mapping` `transform` `metric` `source` `target` `map` `record` `list_of` `each` `flatten` `note` `import`

`each` and `flatten` are only valid inside mapping bodies. `record` and `list_of` are type keywords used in field declarations.

### 2.7 Vocabulary Tokens

These are **not reserved** — they are context-dependent tokens interpreted by the LLM. They can appear in `( )` metadata or as pipeline steps. This list is open-ended:

- **Constraints:** `pk`, `required`, `unique`, `indexed`, `pii`, `encrypt`
- **Types/formats:** `enum`, `default`, `format`, `ref`
- **Operations:** `filter`, `join`, `coalesce`, `trim`, `lowercase`, `uppercase`, `round`
- **Domain:** `xpath`, `namespace`, `datavault`, `scd`, `hub`, `satellite`

New vocabulary tokens can be introduced at any time without language changes.

### 2.8 Definition Uniqueness

All named definitions — `schema`, `metric`, `mapping`, `fragment`, and `transform` — share a single name space. **No two definitions of any kind may have the same name**, even if they are different entity types. For example, a schema named `customer` and a metric named `customer` is an error.

This rule applies across files: when multiple `.stm` files are validated together, all names across all files must be unique.

Anonymous mappings (those without a name) are exempt from this rule.

> **Future**: The `namespace` block (see `features/15-namespaces/PRD.md`) will scope definitions so that the same base name can exist in different namespaces. Uniqueness will then be enforced per-namespace rather than globally.

---

## 3. Schema Blocks

A schema block declares the structure of a data source or target. Satsuma v2 uses a single `schema` keyword — there is no `table`, `message`, `source`, or `target` distinction at the schema level.

### 3.1 Basic Structure

```
schema <name> (<metadata>) {
  <field declarations>
}
```

Example:

```
schema customers (format parquet) {
  customer_id    UUID       (pk)
  name           VARCHAR(200) (required)
  email          VARCHAR(255) (format email, pii)
  status         VARCHAR(20)  (enum {active, suspended, closed})
  created_at     TIMESTAMPTZ  (required)
}
```

### 3.2 Field Declarations

A field is declared as:

```
<name>  <type>  (<metadata>)
```

- **Name** — bare identifier or backtick-quoted.
- **Type** — a vocabulary token (interpreted by the LLM, not formally validated). Common types: `STRING`, `VARCHAR(n)`, `INT`, `DECIMAL(p,s)`, `BOOLEAN`, `DATE`, `TIMESTAMPTZ`, `UUID`, `JSON`, `TEXT`.
- **Metadata** — optional `( )` block with flags and key-value pairs.

### 3.3 Nested Structures: `record` and `list_of`

Use `record` for a single nested structure and `list_of record` for a repeated nested structure. The unified field declaration pattern is:

```
NAME [TYPE] [(metadata)] [{body}]
```

Where TYPE can be:
- A scalar type: `STRING`, `DECIMAL(12,2)`, etc.
- `record` — single nested structure
- `list_of record` — list of structured elements
- `list_of TYPE` — scalar list (list of primitives)

```
schema order {
  order_id     STRING (pk)
  customer record {
    id           STRING
    email        STRING (pii)
  }
  line_items list_of record {
    sku          STRING (required)
    quantity     INT
    unit_price   DECIMAL(12,2)
  }
}
```

`record` and `list_of record` can be nested to any depth. Metadata goes in `( )` between the type (or name) and `{ }`.

**Scalar lists** — When a list contains primitives rather than structures, use `list_of TYPE` with no braces:

```
schema order {
  order_id     STRING (pk)
  promo_codes  list_of STRING
  tag_ids      list_of INT (classification "INTERNAL")
}
```

This keeps `list_of` as the single way to express repeated data. Scalar lists need no braces because there are no subfields to declare.

### 3.4 Notes

Notes are persistent documentation — they travel with the spec (exported to docs, Excel, etc.), unlike `//` comments which are stripped by tooling.

**On schemas and fields:** notes are metadata, so they go in `( )`. Use `"` for short notes, `"""` when you need Markdown:

```
schema legacy_customers (note "Primary customer store from 2005-2024.") {
  PHONE_NBR  VARCHAR(50) (
    note """
    No consistent format across the dataset:
    - **42%** `(555) 123-4567` — US with parentheses
    - **31%** `555.123.4567` — dot-separated
    - **15%** `+15551234567` — already E.164
    - **8%** `5551234567` — raw 10-digit
    - **4%** other (international, extensions, garbage)
    """
  )
}
```

**At top level or inside mapping blocks:** use `note { }` as a structural block. These often benefit from `"""` for rich Markdown content:

```
note {
  """
  # Legacy Customer Migration

  Part of **Project Phoenix** — decommissioning the legacy SQL Server 2008
  instance by Q2 2026.

  ## Constraints
  - Runs in **batches of 10,000** to prevent memory issues
  - Target enforces referential integrity — addresses created *before* customers
  """
}
```

This distinction follows the three-delimiter rule: `( )` for metadata *about* an element, `{ }` for standalone structural content.

### 3.5 Format-Specific Metadata

Format details go in `( )` on the schema or field:

```
schema commerce_order (format xml, namespace ord "http://example.com/commerce/order/v2", namespace com "http://example.com/common/v1") {
  Order record (xpath "/ord:OrderMessage/ord:Order") {
    OrderId    STRING (xpath "ord:OrderId")
    Channel    STRING (xpath "ord:Channel")
  }
}
```

### 3.6 Fragments

A fragment is a reusable set of field declarations. Fragments are structural templates — they stamp out their fields wherever they are spread.

```
fragment `address fields` {
  street_line_1   VARCHAR(200)
  street_line_2   VARCHAR(200)
  city            VARCHAR(100)
  state_province  VARCHAR(50)
  postal_code     VARCHAR(20)
  country_code    CHAR(2)
}

schema customers {
  customer_id   UUID (pk)
  ...address fields
}
```

The spread `...address fields` inlines all fields from the fragment into the schema.

---

## 4. Mapping Blocks

A mapping block describes how data flows from one or more sources to a target.

### 4.1 Basic Structure

```
mapping <name> {
  source { <schema references> }
  target { <schema reference> }

  <arrow declarations>
}
```

The `source` and `target` sub-blocks use backtick references to previously declared schemas (or declare them inline). The mapping name is optional.

### 4.2 Arrow Declarations

An arrow maps one or more source fields to a target field:

```
source_field -> target_field
source_a, source_b -> target_field
```

#### Multi-source arrows

When a target field derives from multiple source fields, list the sources separated by commas:

```
first_name, last_name -> full_name { "Concatenate with space" }
city, state, zip -> address { "Format as city, state zip" }
orders.amount, orders.tax -> total (derived) { "Sum amount and tax" }
```

Each source is a standard source path (bare field, schema-qualified, or namespace-qualified). The comma separator is unambiguous because metadata uses `( )` delimiters, not commas at the arrow level.

Multi-source arrows appear in lineage as one edge per source field, all pointing to the same target.

#### Direct mapping (no transform)

```
Id -> opp_key
AccountId -> account_key
```

#### With transform pipeline

```
EMAIL_ADDR -> email { trim | lowercase | validate_email | null_if_invalid }
```

#### With natural language transform

```
PHONE_NBR -> phone {
  "Extract digits. If 10 digits assume US +1. Format as E.164.
   If unparseable, set null and log warning."
}
```

#### Mixed pipeline (mechanical + NL)

```
Amount -> amount_usd {
  "Multiply by rate from currency_rates lookup using CurrencyIsoCode"
  | round(2)
}
```

The **first `"..."` in an arrow's `{ }`** is implicitly the transform description. Additional NL strings can appear after pipes.

#### Computed/derived fields (no source)

When the target field has no single source field, omit the left side of the arrow:

```
-> display_name {
  "If CUST_TYPE is null or 'R', concat and trim FIRST_NM + LAST_NM.
   Otherwise use COMPANY_NM."
}

-> migration_timestamp { now_utc() }
```

#### Arrow metadata

Use `( )` on an arrow for metadata (notes, conditions, flags):

```
CUST_ID -> customer_id (note "Deterministic UUID from legacy ID") {
  uuid_v5("6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8", CUST_ID)
}
```

### 4.3 Value Maps

Use `map { }` for discrete value mappings. The `:` separates input from output:

```
CUST_TYPE -> customer_type {
  map {
    R: "retail"
    B: "business"
    G: "government"
    null: "retail"
  }
}
```

#### Conditional maps

```
LOYALTY_POINTS -> loyalty_tier {
  map {
    < 1000: "bronze"
    < 5000: "silver"
    < 10000: "gold"
    default: "platinum"
  }
}
```

#### Wildcard default

Use `default` or `_` for the catch-all entry:

```
StageName -> pipeline_stage {
  map {
    Prospecting: "top_funnel"
    Qualification: "mid_funnel"
    "Value Prop": "mid_funnel"
    Closed_Won: "closed_won"
    Closed_Lost: "closed_lost"
    _: "unknown"
  }
}
```

### 4.4 Nested Mappings

When source and target have nested/repeated structures, use `each` blocks to iterate lists and nest the arrows:

```
each POReferences -> ShipmentHeader.asnDetails (
  note "Each PO reference generates one asnDetails entry.
        Line items and quantities correlated by position."
) {
  .REFNUM -> .orderNo { split("/") | first | to_number }

  each LineItems -> .items {
    .ITEMNO -> .item { trim | "Resolve via MFCS supplier item cross-reference" }
    Quantities.QUANTITY -> .unitQuantity {
      "Divide by 10000 (4 implied decimals), multiply by PO pack size from MFCS"
    }
  }
}
```

The `.` prefix indicates a field relative to the current nesting context. The `each` keyword introduces an iteration over a source list, producing elements in the target list.

### 4.5 Fallback Sources

When a primary source may be null, specify a fallback within the transform:

```
LAST_MOD_DATE -> updated_at {
  parse("MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss a") | to_utc
  | "If null, fall back to CREATED_DATE parsed as MM/DD/YYYY in UTC"
}
```

### 4.6 Flattening

Use a `flatten` block inside a mapping to lift each element of a source list into its own output row:

```
mapping `order lines` {
  source { `commerce_order` }
  target { `order_lines_parquet` }

  flatten Order.LineItems -> order_lines_parquet {
    .LineNumber -> line_number
    .SKU -> sku { trim | uppercase }
  }

  Order.OrderId -> order_id
  // ...
}
```

The `flatten` block iterates the source list and produces one target row per element. Fields outside the `flatten` block (like `Order.OrderId`) are repeated on every output row. Fields inside the block use `.` prefix to reference the current list element.

### 4.7 Multi-Source Joins

Describe joins in natural language within the source block or as a top-level NL string:

```
mapping `opportunity enrichment` {
  source {
    `sfdc_opportunity`
    `sfdc_account`
    "Join on sfdc_opportunity.AccountId = sfdc_account.Id"
  }
  target { `snowflake_opps` }
  // ...
}
```

### 4.8 Note Blocks

Use `note { }` at file top level or inside mapping blocks for contextual documentation:

```
mapping `customer migration` {
  note {
    "All timestamps assumed US Eastern unless otherwise noted.
     NULL handling: source NULLs preserved unless target has a stated default.
     Names are title-cased on migration."
  }

  source { `legacy_sqlserver` }
  target { `postgres_db` }
  // ...
}
```

---

## 5. Reusability

### 5.1 Fragments

Fragments declare reusable field sets for schemas:

```
fragment `audit fields` {
  created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ (required)
  updated_at    TIMESTAMPTZ
  created_by    VARCHAR(100)
}
```

Spread into schemas with `...`:

```
schema users {
  user_id  UUID (pk)
  name     VARCHAR(200)
  ...audit fields
}
```

### 5.2 Named Transforms

Named transforms declare reusable transform logic for mapping pipelines:

```
transform `clean email` {
  "Trim whitespace, lowercase, validate RFC 5322 format, return null if invalid"
}

transform `to utc date` {
  parse("MM/DD/YYYY") | assume_utc | to_iso8601
}
```

Spread into pipelines with `...`:

```
EMAIL_ADDR -> email { ...clean email }
CREATED_DATE -> created_at { ...to utc date }
```

### 5.3 Imports

Import fragments, transforms, or schemas from other files:

```
import { `address fields`, `audit fields` } from "lib/common.stm"
import { `currency rates` } from "lookups/finance.stm"
```

Import syntax follows the pattern `import { <names> } from "<path>"`. Exact resolution semantics (relative paths, registries, etc.) are implementation-defined.

---

## 6. Metric Blocks

A `metric` block declares a business metric: what it measures, where the data comes from, and how it can be sliced. Metrics are consumers of schemas — they appear at the end of a lineage graph, not in the middle.

`metric` is a reserved keyword, not a `schema` with a metadata token. The distinction matters for tooling: lineage tracers and the CLI treat metrics as terminal nodes (data flows *into* them; nothing flows *out*).

### 6.1 Basic Structure

```
metric <name> <display_label>? (<metadata>) {
  <field declarations>
  <note blocks>
}
```

- **name** — bare identifier or backtick-quoted string.
- **display_label** — optional quoted string giving the short business name (e.g. `"MRR"`). This is the label shown in dashboards and documentation.
- **metadata** — required `( )` block describing how the metric is defined.
- **body** — measure field declarations and notes. No mappings or arrows.

### 6.2 Metric Metadata Tokens

These vocabulary tokens go in the `( )` metadata block:

| Token | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `source` | Schema(s) the metric is derived from | `source fact_orders` or `source {fact_orders, dim_customer}` |
| `grain` | The time or dimensional grain | `grain monthly`, `grain daily` |
| `slice` | Dimensions the metric can be cut by | `slice {region, product_line, segment}` |
| `filter` | Row-level filter applied before aggregation | `filter "status = 'active'"` |

### 6.3 Measure Fields

Fields inside a metric body declare the numeric values the metric produces. The `measure` vocabulary token describes aggregation behaviour:

| Token | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `measure additive` | Can be summed across all dimensions |
| `measure non_additive` | Cannot be summed (e.g. ratios, averages) |
| `measure semi_additive` | Can be summed across some dimensions but not others (e.g. balance at a point in time) |

### 6.4 Examples

**Simple revenue metric:**

```stm
metric monthly_recurring_revenue "MRR" (
  source fact_subscriptions,
  grain monthly,
  slice {customer_segment, product_line, region},
  filter "status = 'active' AND is_trial = false"
) {
  value  DECIMAL(14,2)  (measure additive)

  note {
    "Sum of active subscription amounts, normalized to monthly.
     Annual subscriptions divided by 12. Quarterly by 3.
     Excludes trials and churned subscriptions."
  }
}
```

**Multi-source metric with multiple measures:**

```stm
metric customer_lifetime_value "CLV" (
  source {fact_orders, dim_customer},
  slice {acquisition_channel, segment, cohort_year}
) {
  value              DECIMAL(14,2)  (measure non_additive)
  order_count        INTEGER        (measure additive)
  avg_order_value    DECIMAL(12,2)  (measure non_additive)

  note {
    """
    Average revenue per customer over their entire tenure.
    Calculated as: total_revenue / months_active * expected_lifetime_months.
    Expected lifetime derived from cohort survival curves.
    """
  }
}
```

**Metric with no display label:**

```stm
metric churn_rate (
  source {fact_subscriptions, dim_customer},
  grain monthly,
  slice {segment, region}
) {
  value  DECIMAL(5,4)  (measure non_additive)
}
```

### 6.5 What Metrics Are Not

- Metrics are **not schemas.** You cannot use a metric as a `source` or `target` in a `mapping` block.
- Metrics are **not mappings.** They describe what a metric is, not how to compute it step by step. Complex computation logic goes in the `note { }` block in natural language.
- Metrics are **not validated by the parser.** The `source`, `grain`, `slice`, and `filter` tokens are vocabulary tokens interpreted by the LLM or downstream tooling — the parser captures them structurally but does not resolve them.

---

## 7. Vocabulary Conventions

Vocabulary tokens are **not keywords** — they are interpreted by the LLM based on context. This section documents common conventions.

### 7.1 Field Metadata Tokens (used in `( )`)

| Token | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `pk` | Primary key | `(pk)` |
| `required` | Must not be null | `(required)` |
| `unique` | Values must be unique | `(unique)` |
| `indexed` | Should have an index | `(indexed)` |
| `pii` | Personally identifiable information | `(pii)` |
| `encrypt` | Must be encrypted | `(encrypt AES-256-GCM)` |
| `enum` | Restricted value set | `(enum {a, b, c})` |
| `default` | Default value | `(default 0)` |
| `format` | Data format constraint | `(format email)` |
| `ref` | Foreign key reference | `(ref addresses.id)` |
| `xpath` | XML path expression | `(xpath "ord:OrderId")` |
| `namespace` | XML namespace declaration | `(namespace ord "http://...")` |
| `filter` | Row-level filter condition | `(filter QUAL == "ON")` |
| `note` | Persistent documentation | `(note "Converted at daily spot rate")` |

### 7.2 Pipeline Tokens (used in `{ }`)

| Token | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `trim` | Strip whitespace |
| `lowercase` / `uppercase` | Case conversion |
| `coalesce(val)` | Replace null with val |
| `round(n)` | Round to n decimal places |
| `split(sep)` | Split string on separator |
| `first` / `last` | Take first/last element |
| `to_utc` | Convert to UTC |
| `to_iso8601` | Format as ISO 8601 |
| `parse(fmt)` | Parse string with format |
| `null_if_empty` | Convert empty string to null |
| `null_if_invalid` | Convert invalid value to null |
| `drop_if_invalid` | Drop the record if value is invalid |
| `drop_if_null` | Drop the record if value is null |
| `warn_if_invalid` | Log a warning if value is invalid |
| `warn_if_null` | Log a warning if value is null |
| `error_if_invalid` | Fail the pipeline if value is invalid |
| `error_if_null` | Fail the pipeline if value is null |
| `validate_email` | Validate email format |
| `now_utc()` | Current UTC timestamp |
| `title_case` | Convert to title case |
| `escape_html` | Escape HTML entities |
| `truncate(n)` | Truncate to n characters |
| `to_number` | Convert to numeric type |
| `prepend(str)` | Prefix a string |
| `max_length(n)` | Enforce maximum length |

#### Error-handling convention

The `null_if_*`, `drop_if_*`, `warn_if_*`, and `error_if_*` tokens follow a consistent `<action>_if_<condition>` pattern for expressing fallback and error-handling intent in pipelines:

- **`null_if_*`** — replace the value with null (record survives).
- **`drop_if_*`** — discard the entire record.
- **`warn_if_*`** — log a warning and pass the value through.
- **`error_if_*`** — halt the pipeline (fail loudly).

These are vocabulary tokens, not reserved keywords. Implementations decide what "log a warning" or "halt" means concretely. Common conditions include `null`, `invalid`, and `empty`, but the pattern is open — e.g. `drop_if_duplicate` or `warn_if_stale` are valid by convention.

```
EMAIL_ADDR -> email { trim | lowercase | validate_email | drop_if_invalid }
TAX_ID -> tax_id { error_if_null }
PHONE_NBR -> phone { "Parse as E.164" | warn_if_invalid }
```

### 7.3 Domain Tokens

These are freely extensible. Common domain-specific tokens:

- **Data Vault:** `datavault`, `hub`, `satellite`, `link`, `scd`, `hashkey`
- **Streaming:** `watermark`, `late_arrival`, `dedup`
- **Governance:** `classification`, `retention`, `lineage`

## 8. Summary of Changes from v1

| v1 | v2 | Rationale |
|----|-----|-----------|
| `[pk, required]` bracket tags | `(pk, required)` parentheses | `()` = metadata, `[]` freed |
| `@xpath(...)`, `@format(...)` annotations | `(xpath ..., format ...)` in metadata | Unified in `()` |
| `table`, `message`, `source`, `target` keywords | Single `schema` keyword | Simpler — role is contextual |
| `STRUCT { }` / `ARRAY { }` | `Name record { }` / `Name list_of record { }` | Unified field syntax: `NAME TYPE (meta) {body}` |
| `nl("...")` function | Bare `"..."` in `{ }` | NL is first-class |
| `: transform` after arrow | `{ transform }` after arrow | Consistent — `{}` holds content |
| `when/else` clauses | `map { }` with conditions or NL | Simpler, more flexible |
| `fallback` keyword | NL fallback description | Let the LLM interpret |
| `[enum: {a, b}]` | `(enum {a, b})` | Braces for value sets, parens for metadata |
| `note '''...`''` triple-quoted | `(note "...")` or `(note """...""")` | Notes are metadata; `"""` for Markdown |
| `integration { }` block | `note { """...""" }` block | Structured, consistent with delimiter rules |
| `=> target` computed fields | `-> target` (no left side) | Consistent arrow syntax |
