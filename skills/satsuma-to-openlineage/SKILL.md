# Satsuma to OpenLineage

Generate OpenLineage-compliant RunEvent JSON from Satsuma mapping specs, including
column-level lineage, schema facets, documentation, governance, and data modelling
metadata.

## Core concept

Satsuma is a **design-time** specification — it describes what mappings *should* do.
OpenLineage is a **run-time** event model — it describes what jobs *did* do. This
skill bridges the gap by generating **synthetic COMPLETE events** that represent the
full structural lineage from the Satsuma spec. These events can be:

- Pushed to Marquez, DataHub, Atlan, or any OpenLineage-compatible backend
- Used as templates that a runtime integration (Airflow, Spark, dbt) decorates
  with actual run metadata (timestamps, durations, row counts)
- Consumed by data catalogs for design-time lineage before pipelines are built

## Prerequisites

- The `satsuma` CLI must be installed and on PATH.
- The user must provide one or more `.stm` files.

## Step 0: Extract structural context

```bash
# Full workspace graph — all nodes, edges, field-level flow
satsuma graph <file>.stm --json

# All warnings
satsuma warnings <file>.stm --json
```

The graph output gives you everything: schemas (→ Datasets), mappings (→ Jobs),
field-level edges (→ ColumnLineage), and transform classifications.

## Step 1: Ask the user essential questions

1. **Dataset namespace** — "What is the OpenLineage namespace for your datasets?
   This is typically derived from your data platform."
   Examples: `snowflake://account.snowflakecomputing.com`,
   `bigquery`, `postgres://host:5432/db`, `s3://bucket`.
   If schemas live on different platforms, ask for a namespace per source system.

2. **Job namespace** — "What is the namespace for your pipeline jobs?"
   Examples: `airflow://my-dag`, `dbt://project-name`, `satsuma://workspace`.
   Default: `satsuma://workspace` if the user doesn't have a scheduler yet.

3. **Dataset naming convention** — "How should dataset names be qualified?"
   Examples: `database.schema.table`, `schema.table`, `table`.
   If Satsuma schemas use namespaces, offer to use them:
   `namespace::schema` → `database.namespace.schema`.

4. **Output format** — "Should I generate:
   (a) Static JSON files (one per mapping) ready to POST to a backend,
   (b) A Python script using the OpenLineage Python client, or
   (c) A single JSON array of all events?"
   Default: (a) — one JSON file per mapping.

## Step 2: Map Satsuma entities to OpenLineage

### Satsuma schema → OpenLineage Dataset

Every schema becomes a Dataset with:
- `namespace`: from user input (step 1)
- `name`: schema name, qualified per convention (e.g., `raw.crm.customers`)
- `facets.schema`: SchemaDatasetFacet with fields and types
- `facets.documentation`: DocumentationDatasetFacet from `(note "...")`
- `facets.ownership`: OwnershipDatasetFacet from `(owner "...")` / `(steward "...")`
- `facets.satsuma_governance`: custom facet for PII, classification, retention, etc.
- `facets.satsuma_modelling`: custom facet for dimension/fact/hub/satellite tokens

### Satsuma mapping → OpenLineage Job + RunEvent

Every mapping becomes a Job, and we emit one synthetic COMPLETE RunEvent per mapping:
- `job.namespace`: from user input
- `job.name`: mapping name (e.g., `customer-migration`)
- `job.facets.documentation`: from mapping `note {}` blocks
- `job.facets.jobType`: processing type from merge tokens
- `inputs`: source schemas as InputDatasets
- `outputs`: target schema as OutputDataset with ColumnLineageDatasetFacet
- `run.runId`: a deterministic UUID v5 from the job namespace + name (reproducible)
- `run.facets`: empty (no actual run metadata for design-time events)

### Satsuma arrows → ColumnLineageDatasetFacet

Field-level arrows become column lineage entries on the **output** dataset:

```json
{
  "columnLineage": {
    "_producer": "https://github.com/thorbenlouw/satsuma-lang",
    "_schemaURL": "https://openlineage.io/spec/facets/1-1-0/ColumnLineageDatasetFacet.json#/$defs/ColumnLineageDatasetFacet",
    "fields": {
      "customer_id": {
        "inputFields": [
          {
            "namespace": "snowflake://...",
            "name": "raw.crm.customers",
            "field": "CUST_ID"
          }
        ],
        "transformationDescription": "uuid_v5(\"namespace\", CUST_ID)",
        "transformationType": "INDIRECT"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See `references/facet-mapping.md` for the complete mapping rules.

## Step 3: Generate events

For each Satsuma mapping, use the CLI to extract arrows:

```bash
satsuma mapping "<mapping-name>" --json
```

Then build the RunEvent. See `references/event-template.md` for the full
JSON structure.

### Transform classification → transformationType

| Satsuma classification | OpenLineage transformationType |
|---|---|
| `[none]` (direct copy) | `DIRECT` |
| `[nl]` (has transform body) | `INDIRECT` |
| `[nl-derived]` (inferred from @ref) | `INDIRECT` |

### Multi-source arrows

When an arrow has multiple source fields (`a, b -> target`), list all source
fields in the `inputFields` array:

```json
"full_name": {
  "inputFields": [
    { "namespace": "...", "name": "...", "field": "first_name" },
    { "namespace": "...", "name": "...", "field": "last_name" }
  ],
  "transformationDescription": "Concat first_name + ' ' + last_name",
  "transformationType": "INDIRECT"
}
```

### Computed fields (no source)

Fields with `-> target { ... }` (no left side) use an empty `inputFields` array
with a description:

```json
"ingest_timestamp": {
  "inputFields": [],
  "transformationDescription": "now_utc",
  "transformationType": "INDIRECT"
}
```

## Step 4: Handle governance metadata as custom facets

Satsuma governance tokens don't have standard OpenLineage facets, so emit them
as custom facets with the `satsuma_` prefix:

```json
{
  "satsuma_governance": {
    "_producer": "https://github.com/thorbenlouw/satsuma-lang",
    "_schemaURL": "https://github.com/thorbenlouw/satsuma-lang/blob/main/openlineage/SatsumaGovernanceDatasetFacet.json",
    "piiFields": ["email", "phone", "tax_id"],
    "classification": "RESTRICTED",
    "retention": "7y",
    "compliance": ["GDPR", "SOX"],
    "owner": "data-platform-team",
    "steward": "Jane Smith",
    "fieldClassifications": {
      "email": { "classification": "RESTRICTED", "retention": "3y",
                 "encrypt": "AES-256-GCM", "mask": "partial_email" }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 5: Handle data modelling metadata as custom facets

```json
{
  "satsuma_modelling": {
    "_producer": "https://github.com/thorbenlouw/satsuma-lang",
    "_schemaURL": "https://github.com/thorbenlouw/satsuma-lang/blob/main/openlineage/SatsumaModellingDatasetFacet.json",
    "entityType": "dimension",
    "scdType": 2,
    "naturalKey": "customer_id",
    "trackedFields": ["email", "phone", "loyalty_tier"],
    "ignoredFields": ["last_login_channel"],
    "conformed": true
  }
}
```

For facts:
```json
{
  "satsuma_modelling": {
    "entityType": "fact",
    "grain": ["transaction_id", "line_number"],
    "dimensionRefs": [
      { "dimension": "dim_customer", "joinField": "customer_id" },
      { "dimension": "dim_product", "joinField": "sku" }
    ],
    "measures": {
      "quantity": "additive",
      "net_amount": "additive",
      "unit_price": "non_additive"
    }
  }
}
```

For Data Vault entities, use equivalent structure with `hub`, `satellite`, `link`.

## Step 6: Handle merge strategy as a job facet

```json
{
  "satsuma_mergeStrategy": {
    "_producer": "https://github.com/thorbenlouw/satsuma-lang",
    "_schemaURL": "https://github.com/thorbenlouw/satsuma-lang/blob/main/openlineage/SatsumaMergeStrategyJobFacet.json",
    "strategy": "upsert",
    "matchOn": ["customer_id"],
    "onMatch": "update",
    "onNoMatch": "insert"
  }
}
```

## Step 7: Handle consumer schemas

Satsuma `(report)` and `(model)` schemas are leaf-node consumers. They become
OutputDatasets on a synthetic "consumption" job, or can be emitted as standalone
datasets with documentation and ownership facets.

If a consumer has `(source {schema1, schema2})`, generate an additional synthetic
job that shows the consumption dependency:

```json
{
  "job": {
    "namespace": "satsuma://workspace",
    "name": "weekly_sales_dashboard",
    "facets": {
      "jobType": {
        "processingType": "BATCH",
        "integration": "SATSUMA",
        "jobType": "REPORT"
      }
    }
  },
  "inputs": [
    { "namespace": "...", "name": "fact_orders" },
    { "namespace": "...", "name": "dim_product" }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "namespace": "looker://instance",
      "name": "weekly_sales_dashboard",
      "facets": {
        "documentation": {
          "description": "Executive weekly sales overview"
        },
        "satsuma_consumer": {
          "consumerType": "report",
          "tool": "looker",
          "dashboardId": "retail-weekly-001",
          "refreshSchedule": "Monday 06:00 UTC"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 8: Validate and present

1. Validate every generated event against the OpenLineage 2-0-2 schema:
   - Required fields: `eventTime`, `producer`, `schemaURL`, `run.runId`
   - All facets have `_producer` and `_schemaURL`
   - `columnLineage` is on output datasets only
   - Dataset names use dot-qualified format
   - No duplicate runIds across events

2. Present the output files to the user with a summary:
   - Number of events generated
   - Number of datasets (input/output)
   - Number of jobs
   - Column-level lineage coverage (fields with lineage / total target fields)
   - Any NL transforms that produced `INDIRECT` lineage
   - Any governance metadata emitted as custom facets

## Important design decisions

**Why synthetic COMPLETE events?** OpenLineage requires at least a START and
COMPLETE event per run. For design-time lineage, we emit only COMPLETE events
with all metadata attached. This is the pattern used by dbt's OpenLineage
integration for static lineage. Backends like Marquez accept this gracefully.

**Why deterministic UUIDs?** Using UUID v5 with the job name as input means
re-running the generator produces the same runIds. This makes events idempotent —
re-emitting to a backend updates rather than duplicates.

**Why custom facets for governance?** OpenLineage has standard facets for schema,
documentation, ownership, and data source, but not for PII, classification,
retention, or data modelling tokens. Custom facets with the `satsuma_` prefix are
the spec-compliant way to carry this metadata. Backends that don't understand
them will ignore them safely; backends that do (or custom integrations) can use
them for governance dashboards.

**Mechanical columns**: For Kimball and Data Vault schemas, inferred columns
(surrogate keys, hash keys, validity timestamps) should be included in the
SchemaDatasetFacet — unlike in Satsuma files where they are omitted, OpenLineage
consumers expect the full physical schema. Add them based on the modelling tokens
and note their origin in the `satsuma_modelling` facet.
