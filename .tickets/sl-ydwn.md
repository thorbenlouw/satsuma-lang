# Validate site/ Satsuma examples and language claims

Audit all .stm code snippets and language feature claims on the site/ pages (index.html, examples.html, learn.html, cli.html, vscode.html). Ensure examples use current v2 syntax (backtick labels, no single quotes, name record {} not record name {}, list_of record, each/flatten instead of [], @ref in NL). Verify feature descriptions match the current spec and CLI capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All inline Satsuma snippets on site/ pages use valid v2 syntax
- No references to removed features (single-quote labels, [] array paths)
- Feature claims match current spec (SATSUMA-V2-SPEC.md) and CLI command set
- Any outdated screenshots or diagrams flagged for update

## Notes

**2026-03-26T09:50:00Z**

Cause: Site code examples used v1 single-quote labels; stats were stale from months of development.
Fix: Migrated all 23 Satsuma code blocks across index.html and examples.html from `'name'` to `` `name` `` backtick labels. Updated stats across index.html, cli.html, and vscode.html to match actual counts: parser tests 245→532, CLI tests 772→824, LSP tests 142→179/154→179. learn.html, cli.html (non-code), and vscode.html had no Satsuma syntax issues.
