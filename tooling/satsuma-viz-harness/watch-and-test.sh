#
# When .run-tests is created (e.g. by `touch .run-tests`), this script:
#   1. Kills any stale server on port 3333
#   2. Runs `npx playwright test`
#   3. Writes output to .playwright-results.txt
#   4. Removes .run-tests so the trigger is reset
#
# Claude touches .run-tests to request a test run; results appear in
# .playwright-results.txt for Claude to read.
