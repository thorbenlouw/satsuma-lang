/**
 * import-reachability.ts — Per-file symbol reachability from import declarations
 *
 * Implements ADR-022's "selective transitive import reachability" rule: an
 * imported symbol brings only itself and its exact transitive dependencies
 * into scope, not every definition from the transitively reachable files.
 *
 * The main export is computeImportReachability(). It accepts a SemanticIndex
 * (the full workspace index) and a per-file import map, and returns a
 * per-file set of symbol keys that are in scope for each file.
 *
 * Consumers (CLI validate, LSP diagnostics) use the resulting ImportReachability
 * to enforce import-scope checks without reimplementing the algorithm.
 *
 * This module does NOT own index construction or import path resolution —
 * those remain in the consumer's workspace/index-builder layer. It operates
 * purely on resolved data: qualified symbol keys and absolute file paths.
 */

/**
 * Compute per-file symbol reachability from the import graph and workspace index.
 *
 * For each file F in the workspace, the reachable set includes:
 *   1. All symbols defined locally in F (always in scope).
 *   2. Symbols explicitly named in F's import declarations.
 *   3. Transitive dependencies of each imported symbol — e.g. a schema's
 *      spread fragments, a mapping's source/target schemas.
 *
 * When a file has no imports and is the only file in the workspace, all
 * symbols are local and therefore reachable — the check is a no-op.
 *
 * @param index       The full workspace SemanticIndex (all files merged).
 * @param fileImports Per-file resolved import declarations. Key is the
 *                    absolute file path; value is the list of imports.
 * @returns Per-file reachability sets.
