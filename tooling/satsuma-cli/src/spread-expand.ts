/**
 * spread-expand.ts — CLI bridge between WorkspaceIndex and satsuma-core spreads
 *
 * Spread expansion logic lives in satsuma-core/src/spread-expand.ts. Per
 * ADR-005, core uses EntityRefResolver and SpreadEntityLookup callbacks so
 * it never has to know about WorkspaceIndex. This module's job is to build
 * those callbacks from a WorkspaceIndex and expose expand* functions with
 * the index-shaped signatures CLI callers expect.
 *
 * Owns: WorkspaceIndex → callback adaptation.
 * Does not own: the spread expansion algorithm itself (that is in core).
