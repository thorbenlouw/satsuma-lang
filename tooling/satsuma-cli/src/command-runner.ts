/**
 * command-runner.ts — Top-level dispatcher for CLI command handlers
 *
 * Owns the single point in the CLI where `process.exit` is called. Every
 * Commander `.action(...)` handler is wrapped in {@link runCommand}, which
 * normalises three completion paths:
 *
 *   1. The handler returns normally — exit with code 0 (or the numeric value
 *      it returned, for handlers that need to surface a non-zero "soft"
 *      result like `validate` or `lint` reporting findings).
 *   2. The handler throws a {@link CommandError} — print its message to the
 *      requested stream and exit with the carried code. This is the path
 *      handlers use for "expected" failures like *not found*, bad arguments,
 *      or unreadable input. The message is part of the contract; the runner
 *      does not decorate it.
 *   3. The handler throws anything else — print `Unhandled error: <msg>` to
 *      stderr and exit 2. This is the safety net for genuine bugs (a parser
 *      crash, a TypeError) so they don't escape silently.
 *
 * Why this exists: before sl-3291 the CLI had 53 inline `process.exit` calls
 * scattered across 23 files. That made it impossible to write tests against
 * the error paths without stubbing the global `process` object, and made it
 * impossible for the CLI to be embedded in another process (each handler
 * unilaterally killed the host). Concentrating the exit policy here means:
 *
 *   • handlers are pure functions of their inputs, returning or throwing —
 *     trivially testable without process stubs;
 *   • exit codes are uniform across commands (no command can quietly drift
 *     to a non-standard convention);
 *   • the rules for "what counts as an error" live in one place that a
 *     reader can find by following any handler's wrapper.
 *
 * The constants here are the single source of truth for CLI exit codes;
 * `errors.ts` re-exports them for backward compatibility with callers that
 * import them from the older location.

/**
 * Structured failure raised by command handlers and shared utilities.

 * with a user-facing message. The runner catches it, writes `message` to
 * the chosen stream, and exits with `code`. Handlers must never call
 * `process.exit` directly — that responsibility belongs to {@link runCommand}.
 *
 * The empty-message case (`new CommandError("", code)`) is supported for
 * the situation where the handler has already printed multi-line output
 * (e.g. per-file parse warnings from `loadFiles`) and only needs to signal
 * the exit code. The runner skips printing in that case.

 * tail of large `--json` payloads. Several commands emit multi-megabyte
 * graphs, so the truncation is observable in practice — see the
 * `graph.test.ts` regression that motivated this drain.
 *
 * The empty-write callback fires when each stream's internal buffer is
 * empty, which is the cheapest way to wait for a flush without taking
 * a hard dependency on the `tty` vs `pipe` distinction. We do both
 * streams in parallel because there's no ordering constraint between
