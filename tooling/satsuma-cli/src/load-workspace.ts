/**
 * load-workspace.ts — One-call workspace loader for CLI commands
 *
 * Owns the standard "resolve a path argument → parse files → build the
 * extracted workspace" pipeline that almost every CLI command needs. Keeping
 * it in one place gives us:
 *
 *   • a single, consistent error contract (resolve failures, empty
 *     workspaces, and unreadable files all report the same way across
 *     commands), and
 *   • a single place to evolve when sl-67k7 (R7, typed errors) lands.
 *
 * Out of scope: per-file parse-error tolerance (`fmt` needs that), two-path
 * loads with `followImports: false` (`diff`), and JSON-formatted resolve
 * errors (`validate --json`). Those three commands continue to call
 * `resolveInput` / `loadFiles` / `buildIndex` directly because their
 * error semantics are genuinely different — wrapping them here would just
 * push the complexity into option flags.

 * Resolve a path argument and load the full workspace, exiting with a
 * standard message on the common failure modes:
 *
 *   • `resolveInput` throws (bad path, directory argument, …) →
 *     `Error resolving path '<arg>': <message>` on stderr, exit code 2.
 *   • A file cannot be read → handled by {@link loadFiles} (warn on stderr,
 *     exit code 2).
 *
 * Files with parse errors are kept (a warning is printed) so commands can
 * still operate on partially-broken workspaces; this matches the long-
 * standing per-command behaviour and is what {@link loadFiles} already does.
 *
 * `resolveInput` always returns at least the entry file (it seeds the
 * import-graph traversal with the entry path itself), so there is no
 * "empty workspace" branch to handle here.
